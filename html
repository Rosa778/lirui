                <p> <b id="Bold-black"> The Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca):</b>
                    also known as the
                    panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised
                    by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to
                    distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order
                    Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of
                    its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat
                    in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams,
                    shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food. </p>

                </a>
                <p> The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in
                    neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the
                    giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a
                    conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity
                    inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in
                    captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population estimates
                    vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006
                    study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some
                    reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015,
                    conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or
                    16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered" to
                    "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities
                    also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable rather than endangered. </p>
                <p> While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has
                    often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts,
                    for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of
                    the Beijing Olympics. </p>

            <div id="description" class="container tab-pane fade"> <br>
                <p> <b id="Bold-black"> The Giant Panda</b>
                    has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11
                    inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (4–6 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to
                    35 in) tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb). Females (generally
                    10–20% smaller than males) can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125
                    kg (276 lb). The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).</p>
                <p> The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches,
                    muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not
                    know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold colouring
                    provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat, and that their eye
                    patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, woolly coat
                    keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of
                    durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with
                    increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a
                    3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.[citation needed]
                    Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth
                    and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.</p>
                <p> The giant panda's paw has a "thumb" and five fingers; the "thumb" – actually a modified sesamoid
                    bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating. Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his
                    book of essays on evolution and biology, The Panda's Thumb.</p>
                <p> The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in), is the second-longest in the bear family,
                    behind the sloth bear.</p>
                <p>The giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. A
                    female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age
                    of 38 on 16 October 2016.</p>

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant
                    panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the
                    giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,
                    and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest
                    cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Pandas are born with sterile intestines
                    and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. The giant panda is
                    a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of
                    years.</p>
                <p>The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to
                    compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of
                    material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible
                    plant material through the short, straight digestive tract. It is also noted, however, that
                    such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal
                    tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda
                    defecates up to 40 times a day. The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected
                    the panda's behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply
                    sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.</p>
                <p>Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its
                    bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: "[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low
                    body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This
                    lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient
                    poor resources such as bamboo." Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of
                    powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and
                    grind fibrous plant material.</p>
                <p>The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the
                    ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4
                    mya with the emergence of A. microta. Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the
                    dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor,
                    resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. Umami taste corresponds to high
                    levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant
                    panda. Although the pseudogenisation of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with
                    the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary
                    change. The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2
                    mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7
                    mya, signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was
                    initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.</p>
                <p>Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala and Fargesia
                    rufa. Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo
                    leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.</p>
                <p> Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the
                    giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation.
                    While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat,
                    fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet,
                    though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.</p>
                <p> Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that
                    they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas
                    tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their
                    foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from
                    the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the
                    summer months, bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low
                    calcium rates in the pandas. During breeding season, the pandas would return to lower altitudes to
                    eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.</p>
                <h3>Predators</h3>
                <p>
                    Although adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable
                    to attacks by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, eagles, feral dogs, and the Asian black
                    bear. Sub-adults weighing up to 50 kg (110 lb) may be vulnerable to predation by leopards. </p>

            </div>

            <div id="behavior" class="container tab-pane fade"> <br>
                <p> The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the
                    bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are
                    generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other
                    females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which
                    pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone
                    to raise the cub.</p>
                <p> Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn
                    and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with
                    activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, they can be active
                    at any time of the day. Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with
                    an increase from November through the following March. Activity is also directly related to the
                    amount of sunlight during colder days.</p>
                <p> Pandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying
                    urine. They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not
                    establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other
                    subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely
                    primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.</p>
                <p> Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out
                    of irritation rather than aggression.</p>
                <p> Pandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to protect themselves against cold
                    temperatures.</p>
                <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                <p>Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination,
                    as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some
                    scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating[84] and giving
                    the males sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra). Only recently have researchers started having
                    success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable
                    breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal
                    reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.</p>
                <p>Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until
                    age 20. The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts
                    for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching,
                    head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time ranges from 30 seconds to
                    five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilisation. The
                    gestation period is somewhere between 95 and 160 days - the variability is due to the fact that the
                    fertilized egg may linger in the reproductive system for a while before implanting on the uterine
                    wall.</p>
                <p>Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually only
                    one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will
                    die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since
                    she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.</p>
                <p>When the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless, weighing only 90 to 130 g
                    (3+1⁄4 to 4+1⁄2 oz), or about 1 / 800 of the mother's weight, proportionally the smallest baby of
                    any placental mammal. It nurses
                    from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four
                    hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks
                    after birth, the cub's skin turns grey where its hair will eventually become black. Slight pink
                    colour may appear on the cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its
                    mother's saliva. A month after birth, the colour pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its
                    fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days; mothers play
                    with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo
                    after six months, though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first
                    year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg (100 pounds) at one year and live with their mothers until they
                    are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.</p>
                <p>In July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived
                    through artificial insemination using frozen sperm. The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that
                    year in Sichuan as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old. The technique for freezing
                    the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a
                    solution to the dwindling availability of giant panda semen, which had led to inbreeding.
                    Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the
                    species. It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and
                    Mexico City will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas. In
                    August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births
                    ever reported.</p>
                <p> Attempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy where cloned panda
                    embryos were implanted into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda
                    fetuses, but no live births.</p>

                <p>
                    In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried
                    with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan
                    two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient
                    China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan
                    tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda
                    pelts to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia Erya.</p>
                <p>The creature named mo (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda.
                    The dictionary Shuowen Jiezi (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the mo, from Shu (Sichuan), is
                    bear-like, but yellow-and-black, although the older Erya describes mo simply as a "white
                    leopard". The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature pixiu (貔貅) as referring to the
                    giant panda is also common.</p>
                <p>During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a
                    captured zouyu (騶虞), and another zouyu was sighted in Shandong. Zouyu is a legendary "righteous"
                    animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere
                    monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in
                    some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the
                    creature captured during the Yongle era, J. J. L. Duyvendak exclaims, "Can it possibly have been a
                    Pandah?"</p>
                <h3>Western discovery</h3>
                <p>The West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French missionary Armand
                    David received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda
                    is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt,
                    Jr., became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the Field Museum of
                    Natural History in the 1920s. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live
                    giant panda, a cub named Su Lin who went to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. In 1938,
                    Floyd Tangier Smith captured and delivered five giant pandas to London, they arrived on 23 December
                    aboard the SS Antenor. These five were the first on British soil and were transferred to
                    London Zoo. One, named Grandma, only lasted a few days. She was taxidermized by E. Gerrard and
                    Sons and sold to Leeds City Museum where she is currently on display to the public. Another, Ming,
                    became London Zoo's first Giant Panda. Her skull is held by the Royal College of Surgeons of
                    England.</p>

                            diplomacy</a></strong>
                </p>
                <p>Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the
                    People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges
                    between China and the West. This practice has been termed "panda diplomacy".</p>
                <p>By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, China began to offer pandas to
                    other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and
                    a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. Since 1998, because of a
                    WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only allows a US zoo to import a panda if
                    the zoo can ensure that China will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts
                    for the giant panda and its habitat.</p>
                <p>In May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait
                    relations – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the
                    transfer would be considered "domestic" or "international", or whether any true conservation purpose
                    would be served by the exchange. A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland,
                    resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from tuanyuan, meaning
                    "reunion", i.e. "reunification"). China's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then
                    President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was
                    accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.</p>

            <div id="conservation" class="container tab-pane fade"> <br>
                <p>The giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and habitat
                    fragmentation, and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is
                    currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched
                    through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since
                    it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas
                    in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a
                    source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the
                    pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including
                    pandas. During the Cultural Revolution, all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were
                    stopped. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to
                    illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.
                </p>
                <p>In 1963, the PRC government set up <strong style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><a
                    href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/sichuan/chengdu/wolong.htm" target="_blank">Wolong National Nature</a></strong> Reserve to save the declining panda
                    population. However, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made at the time, owing to
                    inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas
                    was to cage them. Because of the destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused
                    by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws
                    (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of
                    survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to
                    increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a rare species.</p>
                <p>In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been
                    underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate
                    the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda
                    droppings, scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000. In 2006, there were
                    40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998. As the species has been
                    reclassified to "vulnerable" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working.
                    Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China
                    announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead
                    reinforce the conservation efforts.</p>
                <p>The giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few
                    in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                    designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest province of Sichuan and
                    covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.</p>
                <p>Not all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. Chris
                    Packham has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is "pointless" because "there is not
                    enough habitat left to sustain them". Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be
                    better spent elsewhere, and has said he would "eat the last panda if I could have all the money
                    we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with".
                    He also quoted, "The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last
                    half century", though he has apologised for upsetting people who like pandas. However, a
                    2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their
                    habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70%
                    of mammals and 31% of amphibians.</p>
                <p>In 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct
                    important environmental research, launched a program called "On the Trail of Giant Panda". This
                    program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas
                    cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live
                    longer and healthier lives.[123] Efforts to preserve the panda bear populations in China have come
                    at the expense of other animals in the region, including snow leopards, wolves, and dholes.</p>
                <p> In order to improve living and mating conditions for the fragmented populations of pandas, nearly 70
                    natural reserves have been combined to form the Giant Panda National Park in 2020. With a size of
                    10,500 square miles, the park is roughly three times as large as Yellowstone National Park and
                    incorporates the Wolong National Nature Reserve. The state-owned Bank of China helped to enable the
                    project with US$1.5 billion. One major aim is to permanently keep the panda population stable enough
                    to avoid a relapse to its former IUCN Red List "endangered" status. Especially small, isolated
                    populations run the risk of inbreeding and smaller genetic variety makes the individuals more
                    vulnerable to various defects and genetic mutation. Allowing a larger group of individuals to roam
                    through a larger area freely and choose from a greater variety of mates, helps to enrich genetic
                    diversity of their offspring.</p>
                <p> In 2020, the panda population of the new national park was already above 1,800 individuals, which is
                    roughly 80 percent of the entire panda population in China. Establishing the new protected area in
                    the Sichuan Province also gives various other endangered or threatened species, like the Siberian
                    tiger, the possibility to improve their living conditions by offering them a habitat. Other
                    species who benefit from the protection of their habitat include the snow leopard, the golden
                    snub-nosed monkey, the red panda and the complex-toothed flying squirrel.</p>
                <p> In July 2021, Chinese conservation authorities announced that giant pandas are no longer endangered
                    in the wild following years of conservation efforts, with a population in the wild exceeding 1,800.
